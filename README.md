# Data-Acquisition
Data acquisition programs for Advanced Lab experiments

This repository includes the current DAQ programs for the available experiments in PHYS 360: Advanced Lab. The programs are arranged in folders titled with the short name of the lab. 

Students should download all programs in the relevant folder to the hard drive of the computer they'll be using for data acquisition.

If updates to the program are required, please discuss with your instructor so we can upload the most recent working version.

The types of files include:
- .m files (Matlab)
- .vi files (LabVIEW)
- .py files (Python)
