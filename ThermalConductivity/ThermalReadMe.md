Notes on running thermal conductivity:

Students have found that this program can be fussy. You need to turn on the voltmeter BEFORE you open the LabVIEW program and run it. 

As with all LabVIEW programs, use NI Max to check that you are properly connected to the voltmeter and have the correct device address. Ask your instructor for help if this is all new!
